This is a parser intended to grab the questions and answers from QA websites (eg yahoo.answers.com, ask.com, ...) along with any necessary meta data

The parser is intended to provide a framework for grabbing the data from a QA website. 
Modules should be written for a specific QA website and plug into the parser framework

QAParser/ holds the framework that should take care of the DB insertion and running the parser on a given url

QAModules/ holds the modules for a given website structured in a not-yet-determined fashion

note we are using BeatifulSoup to parse webpages:
